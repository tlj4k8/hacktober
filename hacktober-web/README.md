# hacktober-web

Our Hacktober team created a Vue application in order to view and analyze Zillow
home data.

## First Time Setup

### Requirements

1. Preferred text editor or IDE - Code editor (e.g. Atom, VSCode, Sublime, etc.)
2. [Git](http://git-scm.com/download "Git") - Version Control and connection to
   Github
3. [Node (latest stable version)](https://nodejs.org/en/download "Node (latest stable version)")
  -  Dependency manager and server (Installing node also installs npm)
  -  Codebase tested with Node v14.14.0
  -  Run `node --version` and `npm --version` in the terminal to verify install
    was successful
  -  Although Node's download page has "Windows, Mac, and Source", most common
    Linux-based OSes can get both node and npm through their own package
    managers.

## Project setup
